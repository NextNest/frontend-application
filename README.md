# Next Nest frontend application

Frontend application for [nextnest.xyz](http://nextnest.xyz/).

## Commands

For package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is used â€“ it is fast, reliable enough, and has pretty good lockfiles functionality. While npm@5 has [similar things](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/06/06/does-npm5-deprecate-yarn.html), but let's give it some time.

```shell
yarn install # it is possible to use npm, but versions are locked for yarn
yarn start # will serve from localhost:9000
# or (no difference)
npm start
```
